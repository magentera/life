    "question": "##### Human skills... What are they?",
    "answer": "Have you ever wondered why some people can obtain what they want, when they want it?\n\nWell.. It comes down to exceptional human skills. Human skills are the aspects in human interaction that many people\ntake for granted and sometimes pay less attention too, people that can attain anything have put effort, attention, and developed their human skills,\ngiving them exceptional **_awareness_**, being **_comfortable_** in their surroundings, and ability to **_interact_** **_deliberately_**.\n\nYou might be asking, _So what are some examples human skills?_, I will detail a few that I feel are the most important.\n\n## _What are human skills?_\n\n---\n\n```js\nvar t = function() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!);\n}\n```\n\n### _Mindfulness_\n\n```js\nvar t = function() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!);\n}\n```\n\nOne trait that stands out from the group is mindfulness.\n\nMindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us. I will detail what I consider important human skills but the art of being mindful will take you further then any other skill.\n\nMeditation is sometimes considered exclusively spiritual but there are many benefits detailed here(link).\n\nAll it takes is as little as 5 minutes a day. You can find a detailed guide here(link)\n\nLearn more at Headspace(link)\n\nDeveloping this trait could be the **_single most important_** thing you could do to **_improve_** your human skills.\n\n### _Leaving ego at the door_\n\n```js\nvar t = function() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!);\n}\n```\n\nA noticeable trait of the mindful beings is that they act as if they are in their own world and do what they need too. They are not interested in being the best in the room or being awarded the most accolades, they are focused on doing the next best action to complete their goals.\n\nA useful tip is asking for feedback. Allowing yourself to be critiqued can be difficult at first but you will learn a great deal. Remember to be patient and do not take a defensive stance, they are not attacking you, they are helping you.\n\nAnother useful tip is to be honest with yourself about your abilities, and open up to others that you can learn from. Leaning on the knowledge of others will give you resources that cannot be reached by one person alone.\n\n### _Spending time_\n\n```js\nvar t = function() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!);\n}\n```\n\nAcknowledgement of the time spent on certain tasks can be daunting for most, by realising what we are doing, as we are doing it, is a strong behaviour of mindful beings.\n\nFor the few that can recognise the wasted time and eliminate it quickly can harness the power of being truely productive and accomplish their goals.\n\nThe best way to spend time on the right thing is to ask yourself, 'Is what I'm doing the next best action to complete my goal'. If the answer is no, then take a break and find out what the action should be.\n\n### _Develop relationships with others_\n\n```js\nvar t = function() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!);\n}\n```\n\nDeveloping relationships could possibly be the easiest to learn and apply everyday on your journey to mindfulness. Utilising communication technology of todays age makes this easier than ever before.\n\nMindful beings have a huge wealth of knowledge at their disposal and the reason for that is because they connect with people that are experts in a particular skill. Leveraging off connections will allow you to become one yourself and not a jack of all trades.\n\nTo improve at this skill you could set a simple goal of introducing yourself to one new person per week, and follow up with that same person the next week.\n\n### _Feel the fear and do it anyway_\n\nFear is a huge part of the human existence, we all feel it and we understand generally what we are fearful of. Mindful beings are capable of experiencing the feeling but acting as if they are not fearful. This is something that I believe cannot be taught, but realised as you progress into your mindful journey.\n\nThe ability is a direct result of being in control of your actions and mindset, by applying your attention to the important aspects will reduce the feeling of fear.\n\nThis skill comes with developing a true understanding that time will pass and fear will too.\n\n## _Benefits_\n\n---\n\nThe benefits of having such skills are endless, to name a few;\n\n- Being **_comfortable_** in almost all situations.\n- Getting the most of **_life_**.\n- Fast tracking your **_career_**.\n- Building strong **_friendships_**.\n\n### _Wrapping it up_\n\nI have touched on a few topics that give you some tools to harness the power of effective human skills. \nTry to apply just one of these tips in your daily life and pay attention to the impact its made on your life, good or bad.\n\nI would like to mention that while I'm talking about human skills I am still on my journey and would appreciate feedback or encourage you to reach out to me for a conversation.",
